It provides a secure grip for the surgeon, allowing precise control during incisions. The handle comes in different sizes (commonly #3, #4, etc.) and is used to accommodate different blade shapes depending on the procedure. It is essential in almost all types of surgeries including general, orthopedic, cardiovascular, and plastic surgery.""",

    "Tweezers": """Surgical tweezers, also known as forceps, are fine precision tools used to grasp, hold, or manipulate tissues and other small objects during surgery. They are vital for tasks requiring delicate control, such as suturing, removing debris, or isolating tissue structures. There are various types including toothed, non-toothed, and dressing forceps, each suited to specific surgical scenarios.""",

    "Straight Scissors": """Straight surgical scissors are primarily used for cutting body tissues near the surface of a wound or for cutting sutures and materials. They offer direct, clean cuts and are typically used in procedures where precision is required in linear or superficial incisions. Mayo and Metzenbaum scissors are two common types, with Mayo being more robust and Metzenbaum used for more delicate dissection.""",

    "Curved Scissors": """Curved surgical scissors are designed for cutting deeper tissues or for navigating around anatomical curves. The curvature allows the surgeon to maintain visibility and access within confined or complex anatomical spaces. They're particularly useful in dissection, allowing for precise removal of tissue while minimizing damage to surrounding structures. Common types include curved Mayo and curved Metzenbaum scissors, each optimized for specific surgical tasks.""",
